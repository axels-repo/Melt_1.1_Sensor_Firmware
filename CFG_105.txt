M.E.L.T. SYSTEM CONFIG FILE
- Ensure the number after config filename matches system firmware (Eg. FW version 103 for CFG_103.txt)
- When in doubt, assign value as DEFAULT
- Config format is as follows: "ConfigVariable=Value;"
- Whitespace is ignored. Anything after the semicolon is ignored. Any line that does not contain a ConfigVariable is ignored.
